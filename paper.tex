\section{Analysis}

To aid in my analysis of whether or not Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft trial model is ethical, the Software Engineering Code of Ethics (SE Code) will be used. The SE Code applies to ``professional software engineers, including practitioners, educators, managers, supervisors and policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession.'' \cite{SECode} Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft is a software system that runs on computers. \cite{WoWSystemReqs} Software systems are written by software engineers. \cite{ACMApprovesSECode} According to the Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), all professional software engineers must abide by the rules outlined in the the SE Code. \cite{ACMApprovesSECode}\cite{SECode} Blizzard Entertainment can be seen as a ``practitioner'' in that they are actively engaged in making software, in addition to some of its employees who are software engineers. Therefore, Blizzard Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment's software engineers are subject to the SE Code. \cite{SECode} Being subject to the SE Code allows me to use it to conclude the ethics of World of Warcraft's trial model.

\subsection{Definition of ``addiction''}
Because this paper will often reference psychological addiction, it is important to make sure this notion is concrete before continuing.\\
A person who is addicted to something will pathologically pursue rewards and/or relief through substance abuse or other behaviors, in this case playing World of Warcraft. \cite{DefinitionOfAddiction}

Addiction can be seen as an \emph{inability to abstain} from something, \emph{impairment in behavior control} regarding this thing, and a \emph{craving} for this thing. There will be a diminished recognition of issues with one's behavior, suffering of interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. \cite{DefinitionOfAddiction}

\subsection{SE Code Section 1.02\\Moderate the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client and the users with the public good.}
In the next few sections this tenet is broken down into its parts. I will explore the ``interests of the software engineer,'' in this case World of Warcraft's software engineers, the ``interests of ... the employer,'' in this case Blizzard Entertainment since it employs the software engineers, and lastly the ``interests of ... the client and the users,'' the players who use World of Warcraft. Following that will be a discussion of the ``public good.''\\
After substituting the above into the rule, SE Code Section 1.02 becomes: ``World of Warcraft's Software Engineers shall moderate the interests of themselves, Blizzard Entertainment, and the players of World of Warcraft with the public good.''

\subsubsection{Interests of the Software Engineer}
It is common sense that a software engineer strives to make working software. For World of Warcraft's software engineers, this success is measured by how many players enjoy new content and continue to play the game. Considerations are made for balance and gameplay as well as story. \cite{DevWatercooler} These engineers are also interested in keeping their jobs and continuing to make money. In order to keep their jobs, their interests must lie in getting players buy the software and then to come back to the game world often and play the game.

\subsubsection{Interests of Blizzard Entertainment}
Blizzard Entertainment is a publicly traded company. \cite{BlizzStock} As such its main goal is to show its shareholders that it is profiting and increasing the volume of business it handles. In no uncertain terms, Blizzard Entertainment wants as many people to buy and play their games, World of Warcraft included, as possible. Since World of Warcraft is subscription-based \cite{WoWSubscription}, Blizzard Entertainment earns money every single month from World of Warcraft players. None of the other games that Blizzard makes are subscription based. \cite{BlizzGameList} That means that Blizzard only ever receives one payment for any of its other games from customers. Blizzard Entertainment's interests are in getting more players to buy their games, particularly World of Warcraft which nets them \$13-15 every month in addition to the initial cost. \cite{WoWSubPlans}

\subsubsection{Interests of the Player}
By purchasing a game like World of Warcraft, players are committing themselves to pay Blizzard Entertainment every month. \cite{WoWSubscription} Some players are reaping benefits that they would not be able to get otherwise, such as an increase in social interactions. \cite{IsThereEvidenceOfInternetAddiction} Users who play the game rarely navigate the world alone, instead they form groups with other players, join guilds, and tackle quests and dungeons that require teamwork and talking to others.
One particular study found that MMORPG users play for a mixture of ten reasons: advancement, mechanics, competition, socializing, relationship, teamwork, discovery, role-playing, customization, and escapism. These ten reasons break down into three components: achievement, social, and immersion. \cite{PlayerMotivations} The interests of the player boil down to a sense of achievement, having social interactions, and immersion in a world outside their own.

\subsubsection{``Public Good'' Breakdown}
I define the public good to be the population's mental and physical welfare. A healthy population is not addicted to World of Warcraft and therefore exhibits the ability to abstain from World of Warcraft, have unimpaired behavior control, and not crave playing World of Warcraft.

I will take two approaches to arguing that the public good is being upheld. First will be a purely numerical approach to public good, `` ``Public Good'' By The Numbers'', followed by an argument that the public good is not only being upheld, but improved by World of Warcraft, `` ``Public Good'' Being Improved''.

\subsubsection{``Public Good'' By The Numbers}
In order to argue that the public good is being upheld I assert that Utilitarianism is the most effective ethical system to use because it judges actions based on the net happiness of everyone. Utilitarianism is ``[t]he creed which ... holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.'' \cite{Utilitarianism} A utilitarian view in this case would be that World of Warcraft does not create addiction in the majority of the world and therefore does not diminish mental or physical welfare of the public.

The most shocking statistic I found came from Dr. Maressa Orzack, founder and coordinator of Computer Addiction Services \cite{CompAddictionServices}, who cites that up to 40\% of World of Warcraft players could be addicted. \cite{FortyPercentAddicted} If everyone in the world played World of Warcraft, a total of over 7 billion people \cite{WorldPopulation}, and Dr. Ozark's prediction is correct, 2.8 billion people would be addicted. Based purely on the numbers that leaves 60\% of the world's population that is not addicted.

\subsubsection{``Public Good'' Being Improved}
World of Warcraft has over 10 million subscribers \cite{WoWPlayerCount} who average 22 hours of play time per week. \cite{PlayerMotivations} A study published in \emph{Cyberpsychology \& Behavior} \cite{ExcessiveUseForSocialAspects} states, ``[i]t is clear that MMORPG users have a tendency to spend many more hours devoted to their game and find the social aspects of the in-game world more pleasant and satisfying than what occurs in the real world. However, MMORPG users do not seek self-confidence in-game, would find fun elsewhere if MMORPGs did not exist, and would not feel irritated if they did not have the chance to play for 1 day. This would suggest that, as much as MMORPG users enjoy the time they spend in-game, even more so than real-life activities with friends, they are not addicted.'' World of Warcraft players are passionate about their experiences in the game, but they do not show signs of addiction.

In a case study of five ``problematic'' internet and game users, users who are seen by family and friends as having extreme computer addiction issues, only two showed signs of true addiction while the remaining three seemed to be using the internet to counter-act other deficiencies. \cite{IsThereEvidenceOfInternetAddiction} These three users who were not psychologically addicted used the internet and games to connect with others in ways they couldn't previously. Factors keeping them from doing so prior were due to physical appearance, social anxiety, and mental disability. One European man found a wife in the United States and moved to be with her, improving both their lives, thanks to his extended internet use. \cite{IsThereEvidenceOfInternetAddiction} These people use the internet and games as a way to enrich their lives, not detract from them.

During a panel at D.I.C.E. 2012 \cite{DICEInterview} that included Mike Epps, President of Epic Games, Ted Price, CEO and Founder of Insomniac Games, and Frank Pearce, current VP of product development and one of the three founders of Blizzard, Frank Pearce had this to say about World of Warcraft:
\begin{quote}
[W]e hear stories all the time, in fact right when we were walking out for the break, someone came up to me and said ``I just want you to know, I'm in this industry because I suffered a back injury and I spent six years playing Warcraft and decided I wanted to get into the games industry.'' We get letters from players all the time that can't experience the real world in the way that they would like to because of physical limitations and can live a completely free experience in a game like World of Warcraft.
\end{quote}
Blizzard Entertainment is doing so many people a service that they actually receive letters thanking them for making such an immersive experience.

In a three year study of over 30,000 MMORPG users, over 50\% of users said that they learned valuable leadership skills that have helped them outside of the game. \cite{MotivationsAndDerviedExperiences} To break it down further, 55.5\% of users believed they learned about conflict mediation, 48.4\% believed they learned about properly motivating a group, and 43.8\% believed they learned about persuading other members when a change in goals was necessary. \cite{MotivationsAndDerviedExperiences}
The study also showed that 45.8\% of users made friendships in the game that were comparable to or better than friendships they cultivated outside the game. 23.8\% of users had they most rewarding or satisfying experience in the game, as opposed to outside of the game, in the last 7 or 30 days. 28.6\% of users had their most annoying or infuriating experiences over the past 7 or 30 days occurring in the game. \cite{MotivationsAndDerviedExperiences}

Many features in World of Warcraft drive the players to socialize. \footnote{Having over two months of play time in-game with the last play session less than a week ago, I consider myself qualified to discuss the mechanics of World of Warcraft without citation.} The best gear and most prestigious titles are only available to users who group together to take on challenges that cannot be conquered by oneself. These challenges require intense coordination and communication as well as skilled players. Without grouping together, players have no chance of getting these items or attaining these statuses.
Guilds offer perks to their members through mechanics built into the game. As guilds grow in size and their members complete quests and dungeons, these guilds level up and offer rewards such as experience boosts allowing members to level faster, speed boosts allowing members to traverse the map faster, reputation gain boosts allowing members to increase their reputation with factions in the game that offer rewards, durability increases to its members' armor so that the armor does not need to be repaired nearly as often, increases in output from its members professions, and certain powerful spells that can be cast when guild members take on challenges together.

Friendships and powerful experiences help us grow as individuals. MMORPGs, like World of Warcraft, are providing their users with leadership skills, strong friendships, and powerful experiences.

\subsubsection{Ethical Conclusion}
In order for Blizzard's actions to be ethical, its engineers must ``moderate the interests of themselves, Blizzard Entertainment, and the players of World of Warcraft with the public good.''

The interests of the software engineer, creating content that players love, and the interests of the player are complimentary. Players are interested in great content and a full-featured experience and Blizzard's engineers are interested in creating that exact experience and content.
Blizzard Entertainment's interests of growing as a company and keeping its shareholders satisfied are only improved by happy players. Happy players will recommend Blizzard and its products to friends as well as continue to pay monthly fees for World of Warcraft and buy Blizzards other games.

Having a majority of players who are \emph{not} addicted, and thus playing for pleasure or other purposes, is in line with the Utilitarian view of ethical and therefore in line with a cold, calculated numerical view of ``public good.''

Not only are a majority of users not addicted, many of these users are cultivating life skills, strong friendships, and powerful emotional experiences. These users are growing as individuals and going out into the world as stronger people with leadership and teamwork skills.
Some users are even overcoming physical and mental disabilities through use of the game. These users would be mentally and physically distraught without World of Warcraft and thus the public good would be diminished. Because the game is helping these users from having poor welfare, World of Warcraft, and other MMORPGs, can be seen as \emph{improving} the public good.

Blizzard's software engineers are moderating all parties' interests. The public good is not only being upheld, but improved. Therefore, Blizzard Entertainment's actions are not only ethical in accordance with SE Code section 1.02, but can be seen as extraordinary, going beyond moderating their interests and improving the public good.
