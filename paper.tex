\begin{abstract}
Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft has a free ``Starter Edition'' which allows players to access the game indefinitely with restrictions. \cite{starterEditionNewsRelease} Studies show a correlation between time playing and addiction to Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft. \cite{ProblemUsageAmongHighlyEngagedPlayers}\cite{JustAComputerGameRight} Is it ethical for World of Warcraft to use this model?

Based on the principles of Utilitarianism \cite{Utilitarianism}, restricting a free demo on the basis of a few cases of mental instability is unethical, therefore World of Warcraft's ``Starter Edition'' \emph{is} ethical.

%__ Give general context for the issue.
%__ This section must present *ONLY ENOUGH* substantiated facts to raise the question for the reader (not to answer the question, additional facts may be introduced during analysis).

% __ Do not include the definitions of ethical systems or laws as background. Just raise your focus question.
\section{Facts}

World of Warcraft is an incredibly popular game with over 10 million subscribers. \cite{WoWPlayerCount} Players of World of Warcraft spend an average of 22 hours per week playing. \cite{PlayerMotivations} World of Warcraft is free to play provided the player is willing to accept some restrictions. None of those restrictions hinder the number of hours one can play. \cite{StarterEditionFAQ} Multiple studies have shown that time spent playing a MMORPG, like World of Warcraft, correlates to addiction level in some individuals. \cite{ProblemUsageAmongHighlyEngagedPlayers}\cite{JustAComputerGameRight} The intensity with which many players play World of Warcraft or other MMORPGs has led to multiple deaths. \cite{SnowlyDeath}\cite{ShawnDeath}

% [5%] Focus Question (One Non-Compound Sentence Max followed by a short paragraph of 50 words Max)
% __ Must be focused on a particular, specific case. More detail / less abstract is better.
% __ Must call for a binary answer (yes / no) that you will draw based on your research and reasoning.
%__ Should be followed (separately) by a single paragraph of 50 words max explaining the importance of this question and its relevance to software engineers (why should we care?). There should be a citation to an external source to validate such importance.

\section{Research Question}
Is Blizzard's use of World of Warcraft: Starter Edition ethical? \\
World of Warcraft: Starter Edition could precipitate an ``outbreak'' of videogame addiction leading to terrible incidents. \cite{SnowlyDeath} Deaths and addiction linked to World of Warcraft would cause a sharp decline in the sale of games. Blizzard would suffer and be forced to lay off software engineers working on its products.

\section{Arguments}
\subsection{Arguments Affirmative}
\subsubsection{Differing Player Archetypes}
Many studies and surveys disregard the fact that different types of people play MMORPGs for different reasons and these varying archetypes lead to a majority of players who are not in danger of addiction. By not making mention of this fact, sweeping generalizations are made without basis. \cite{PlayerMotivations}
\subsubsection{More Time Online Does Not Mean Addiction}
Many people who are characterized as spending ``excessive'' time online do not show symptoms of addiction, rather they show signs of psychological fulfillment that would otherwise elude them due to disabilities, circumstances, or social discomfort. Some people who are isolated or autistic find comfort in the use of the internet and games to create social relationships they would not have cultivated otherwise. \cite{IsThereEvidenceOfInternetAddiction}
\subsubsection{Excessive Users Do Not Exhibit Addiction Symptoms}
Users that spend more time playing the game than average exhibit characteristics that show using MMORPGs for social aspects of the in-game world as opposed to symptoms of addiction. These users would just as likely find fun elsewhere. \cite{ExcessiveUseForSocialAspects}
\subsection{Arguments Negative}
\subsubsection{More Intense Play By A Younger Audience Leads to Addiction}
``MMORPGs are played more intensely than video games,'' and are played primarily by a younger audience. Persons under the age of 27 (i.e. the majority of players of MMORPGs) are far more susceptible to addiction due to a lack of self identity and self confidence. \cite{YoungerAudiencesGetAddicted}
\subsubsection{Increased Time Playing Leads to Life Problems}
The longer a person plays World of Warcraft, the likelier they are to experience issues in their lives. \cite{ProblemUsageAmongHighlyEngagedPlayers}
\subsubsection{Addictive Games Have a Social Responsibility}
Current efforts to warn players of online games' addictiveness are too minimal and often non-existent. Warning labels should be printed on games and companies should contact users who play in excess of a set threshold. \cite{MMORPGSocialResponsibility}\\

Arguments in favor of my conclusion that World of Warcraft \emph{is} ethical boil down to the fact that people are complex and a simple correlation of time spent playing to a person being psychologically addicted is too far of a stretch. People play for a variety of reasons, many of which are psychologically fulfilling. Arguments against my conclusion bring up that often these players have immature brains and a lack of social identity due to age, leading to increased risk of addiction. They also cite studies that show increased play times leading to life issues and that the companies has a social responsibility to at least warn consumers of possible psychological consequences.

%%% Analysis %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% [70%] Your Analysis (About 3000 Words)
% __ Start with a paragraph showing why the SE Code applies to your focus question. Do not merely conclude, but show the reader by application of Code principles.
% __ Liberally utilize sub-headings organized by the relevant SE Code sections and particular arguments to delineate your lines of reasoning.
% __ All your analysis must be thoroughly supported by reason and logic.
% __ All claims must be supported by reputable primary sources and formal data.
% __ Have 2-4 distinct sections of the SE code utilized in your analysis.
%__ Code section 1 can be central to one piece of analysis only. For example, if you determine section 1.03 applies, then no other section 1 Code tenet may be used later as a section heading.
% __ If discussion about "public good" is used, there must be data to support it. Simply writing "it benefits the general public because it would make many people happy" is insufficient.
% __ Utilitarian, Rawlsian and Deontological analyses must be integrated into your analysis where appropriate. They should support your SE Code analysis, not be isolated from it. (Exceptions must be approved by Dr. Turner.)
% __ Class readings should be referenced as appropriate to support your Code analysis.
% __ There should be a clear cohesiveness to the analysis such that each argument logically flows into the next and the reader is logically convinced that your conclusion has strength. Your writing must explicitly provide substantial arguments through logic and data that will gain the respect of a skeptic.
% __ Do not define ethical systems in your analysis unless they are required and are very brief (a few sentences maximum).
% __ Opinions + Assumptions + Feelings > /dev/null

\section{Analysis}

To aid in my analysis of whether or not Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft trial model is ethical, the Software Engineering Code of Ethics (SE Code) will be used. The SE Code applies to ``professional software engineers, including practitioners, educators, managers, supervisors and policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession.'' \cite{SECode} Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft is a software system that runs on computers. \cite{WoWSystemReqs} Software systems are written by software engineers. \cite{ACMApprovesSECode} According to the Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), all professional software engineers should abide by the rules outlined in the the SE Code. \cite{ACMApprovesSECode}\cite{SECode} Blizzard Entertainment can be seen as a ``practitioner'' in addition to some of its employees who are professional software engineers. Therefore, Blizzard Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment's software engineers are subject to the SE Code. \cite{SECode} Being subject to the SE Code allows me to scrutinize their actions under it.

\subsection{Definition of ``addiction''}
Because this paper will often reference psychological addiction, it is important to make sure this notion is concrete before continuing.
A person who is addicted will pathologically pursue rewards and/or relief through substance abuse or other behaviors, in this case playing World of Warcraft. \cite{DefinitionOfAddiction}

Addiction can be seen as an inability to abstain from something, impairment in behavior control regarding this thing, and a craving for this thing. There will be a diminished recognition of issues with one's behavior, suffering of interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. \cite{DefinitionOfAddiction}

\subsection{SE Code Section 1.02\\Moderate the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client and the users with the public good.}
In the next few sections this tenant is broken down into it's parts. I will explore the ``interests of the software engineer,'' in this case World of Warcraft's software engineers, the ``interests of ... the employer,'' in this case Blizzard Entertainment, and lastly the ``interests of ... the client and the users,'' the player. Following that will be a discussion of the ``public good'' using Utilitarianism and the benefits of videogames to guide my definition.
\subsubsection{Interests of the Software Engineer}

\subsubsection{Interests of Blizzard Entertainment}
Blizzard Entertainment is a publicly traded company. \cite{BlizzStock} As such its main goal is to give its shareholders profits and increase the volume of business it handles. In no uncertain terms, Blizzard Entertainment wants as many people to buy and play World of Warcraft (and its other products) as it can get. Since World of Warcraft is subscription-based \cite{WoWSubscription}, Blizzard Entertainment sees money every single month from World of Warcraft players. None of the other games that Blizzard makes are subscription based \cite{BlizzGameList} and as such World of Warcraft makes Blizzard Entertainment the most money of them all due to its recurring nature. Blizzard Entertainment's interests are in getting more players to buy their games, particularly World of Warcraft.
\subsubsection{Interests of the Player}
By purchasing a game like World of Warcraft, players are committing themselves to pay Blizzard Entertainment every month. Some players are reaping benefits that they would not be able to get otherwise, such as social interactions. \cite{IsThereEvidenceOfInternetAddiction}

\subsubsection{The ``Public Good''}
In order to define the ``public good'' I assert that Utilitarianism is the most effective ethical system to use. Utilitarianism states that ``[t]he creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.'' \cite{Utilitarianism}

\subsubsection{Ethical Conclusion}
MORE INFO HERE

Potential to argue that opponents of my position would say that the game leads to addiction and more time spent playing it means higher chances of addiction. Addiction being bad for the ``public good'' and \emph{not} in the ``interests of the client.'' I will respond with sources saying that time does not correlate to addiction and that high levels of play time do not mean addiction.

\subsection{SE Code Section 2.07\\Identify, document, and report significant issues of social concern, of which they are aware, in software or related documents, to the employer or the client.}
Opponents have suggested warning labels and/or contacting players who exhibit signs of addiction. I may have to concede this point, I see nothing wrong with a few added measures.
``Tip: Remember to take all things in moderation (even World of Warcraft!)'' - In-Game Tip! WoW is at least putting some effort forth.

\subsection{SE Code Section 2.09\\Promote no interest adverse to their employer or client, unless a higher ethical concern is being compromised; in that case, inform the employer or another appropriate authority of the ethical concern.}
The opposition will say that promoting more sales while increasing chances for game addiction is adverse to the client. Again I will argue that just because players are hooked and spending money, does not mean they are addicted and their lives are suffering.

\subsection{SE Code Section 4.04\\Not engage in deceptive financial practices such as bribery, double billing, or other improper financial practices.}
Getting young people hooked on games could be seen as deceptive financial practices in that young people lack impulse control and will be more willing to spend their money frivolously. I will argue that a person's money is their own business and it is not Blizzard's responsibility to ensure a consumer is spending their money wisely.
